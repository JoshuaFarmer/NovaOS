	   However, UEFI has made things more complicated, and experimental data
	   strongly suggests that 2M is a safer place to load. In 2016, a new

	   that a kernel can be loaded anywhere within a range of addresses and
	   will be able to relocate itself to run from such a loader-selected
	   address, in order to give the loader freedom in selecting a span of
	   memory which is verified to be available by the firmware, in order to
	   work around this issue. This does not use that feature, so 2M was
	   chosen as a safer option than the traditional 1M. */
